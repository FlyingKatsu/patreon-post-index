Not so much the principles of animation, I think you'd be better served learning about those some place else. No, the technical side of animation is what I'll be talking about here. Keyframes, interpolation, onion skinning and the action editor.This tutorial assumes you've completed all the tutorials before this and are comfortable with Blender.\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ubFNExR.png\"></p><p><em>What we ended on, last tutorial. Kirby with a movable skeleton</em></p><h3><strong>Animation UI</strong></h3><p>First, let's move to another UI perspective. You may remember from Blender Overview #1 the \"perspectives\" drop down. It contains a list of \"perspectives\" that provide handy setups for the Blender UI for various workloads. And as such, there's also one called \"animation\"!\u00a0</p><p>Let's go ahead and click that one!</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ERGSnn8.png\"></p><p>This will change the the UI to something that looks something like this!</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eIotItU.png\"></p><p>Let's take this thing apart.\u00a0</p><p>1. <em>The dope sheet/Action Editor</em> -- the dope sheet shows nodes for every point in the timeline where a bone or object changes its state somehow (through rotation, movement, scaling or otherwise).</p><p>2. <em>The curves</em> -- these cryptic curves show how Blender is interpolating between the changing states of your bones/objects.</p><p>3. <em>The timeline</em> -- I've already touched upon this part of the UI, but long story short it'll play through this when you play through an animation.\u00a0</p><p>One of the first things you should do is to change where it says \"Dope Sheet\" into \"Action Editor\".</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7E5SQS6.png\"></p><p>The Action Editor, as described above, will let us have separate animations on one model and edit each animation. This comes in handy in, for example, game engines where you might want to play these separate animations at different times by name, rather than by keyframe timings.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qlDvcKU.png\"></p><p>Since this is a fresh model without any animations your action editor will contain... no actions! So, let's press the \"New\" button. It'll make an action called \"Action\". Feel free to rename this into whatever you're about to animate.</p><p>Now, in the 3D view to the left, you should have Kirby up with his bones visible. We already know how to pose bones, but to go over it real quick again:</p><ul> <li>In Pose Mode you can pose bones</li> <li>Right click a bone to select it, the usual controls function for manipulating the bone</li> <li>ALT + 'R' key to reset rotation, ALT + 'G' key to reset location and ALT + 'S' key to reset scaling -- <strong>important</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><h3><strong>Keyframes</strong></h3><p>When posing a model, you'll inevitably want to save this pose as a \"keyframe\" in your animation. Press the 'I' key to save a keyframe to your timeline. It will ask you what part of what you've selected you want to save. LocRotScale will save Location, Rotation and Scale.\u00a0</p><p>This should create a small node in the top left window.\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HEIbUO0.png\"></p><p>Your keyframe should now show up here, as a small node. Selecting it will select that keyframe's properties for that object.\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FFI1OXp.png\"></p><p>So, if you want to select the entire keyframe (for all objects/bones) you right click the top most node. If you only want to select it for, say, the head, you just click the one in the \"head\" row! You can then move this node left and right along the timeline, select multiples and move them together and even scale them! The usual controls apply.</p><p>Now that we actually have a keyframe, let's talk about what keyframes actually mean.</p><p>A keyframe is a marker in time that holds information about your model (like the pose or location). In other words, if you have a keyframe at time 0 with your model just standing and another at time 10 where his arm is lifted up 90 degrees, between time 0 and 10 he'll be moving his arm towards the keyframe as displayed at time 10.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tN9NaSb.png\"></p><p>Blender will smoothly calculate how the objects will be in every frame between frame 0 and 10. You only set Keyframe 0 and 10 up, Blender does the rest. That smoothing in between, we call that \"interpolation\". The way it interpolates (linearly, bezier, etc) will have a significant effect on how the final animation looks.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eB99EhH.png\"></p><ul> <li><strong>Constant</strong> -- It won't change until it gets to frame 10. Frame 0-9, Kirby sits. Frame 10, Kirby stands.</li> <li><strong>Linear</strong> -- No smoothing, it just linearly moves all the bones to their final position.</li> <li><strong>Bezier </strong>-- Smooths the animation at the start and at the end. Very commonly used.</li></ul><p>These are the ones you'll probably use the most often. Experiment with the other interpolation modes for the effect you want!</p><p>Changing the interpolation of a keyframe is easy! Just select the keyframe(s) (in the top left) and press Key (next to where it says \"Action Editor\") -&gt; Interpolation Mode -&gt; [Interpolation Mode that you want].</p><p>Another useful thing are \"Keying sets\". When you press the 'I' key to make a new keyframe Blender continually asks you what you want to save. What if you just always want to save the same properties?</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/36KAGO7.png\"></p><p>At the bottom of the window, you'll find a small section that literally has a set of keys as an icon. Clicking that drop-down (drop-up?) will reveal a set of options. These are \"keying sets\". Clicking one will make it so that whenever you press the 'I' key it will automatically create a keyframe saving those properties of what you have selected.</p><p>I usually go with LocRotScale.</p><h3>Animation</h3><p>Now that we have the tools to animate, let's put together some frames.</p><p>Let's try a simple waving animation. Basically, Kirby will stand, he'll wave his left hand and he'll go back to standing.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/19SBf1J.gif\"></p><p>A very simple animation indeed. In fact, there's much more you can do with this. Like maybe Kirby's body can swing, or maybe he'll get up on his tippy-toes, but you should always start small.</p><p>So, this is what my timeline looks like for this animation.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JtE0nGy.png\"></p><ul> <li>Frame 1 -- Neutral standing position</li> <li>Frame 15 -- Arm up</li> <li>Frame 30 -- Arm down</li> <li>Frame 45 -- Arm up</li> <li>Frame 60 -- Neutral</li></ul><p>The green line is where you currently are on the timeline. Drag it here and there and watch your model animate. Pressing play will automatically play the timeline over the gray area. If you want to extend or shorten the gray area, put your mouse on the timeline and press the 'E' key. It'll then adjust the timeline to where cursor is, only play that far and no further.</p><p>To create this animation, put the cursor on frame 0 and create a \"Neutral standing frame\". Then put the cursor on 60 and copy and paste that standing frame. You can copy the position/rotation/scale of a bone and paste in \u00a0a different frame with Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V.</p><p>Let's press Play!</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pDw8Bw5.png\"></p><p>Too fast? Too slow? Remember, you can select all the nodes in the top-right dope sheet/action editor and scale them. Scaling them to be closer together will make it faster. Scaling them to be further apart will make it slower.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VZhtEvG.gif\"></p><p><em>Remembers, the 'B' key activates rectangle select</em></p><p>That should do it! Now you've got a Kirby. A textured Kirby. A rigged Kirby.

But, if you want to learn it's definitely better to work with your own model!</p><h3><strong>Intro</strong></h3><p>In this part of the Blender Overview series of tutorials we'll be tackling adding an armature to your model. An armature is a \"skeleton\" of sorts, it'll map parts of your model to parts of this skeleton. The arm to the arm bone, the neck to the neck bone and so on. Using this skeleton we'll be able to pose the model and eventually even animate it! Animation in 3D is, after all, just a collection of poses playing in sequence.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OAemw6V.png\"></p><p><em>Our starting point for this tutorial!</em></p><p>Let's discuss armatures first! An armature of a model is a set of bones that will (eventually) move your model's mesh as you move the bones. You can build an armature without a model to go with it or you can build it after the model's done. I usually do the latter.</p><p>Two of the most important modes involved with armatures are \"Edit Mode\" \u00a0(which you're most likely already intimately familiar with by now) and \"Pose Mode\". Pose mode is exclusive to armatures and in pose mode we can move the bones as we want (and moving the mesh with it).</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Wo88fRR.png\"></p><p>Selection, movement and so on work the same as they do in all the other modes.\u00a0</p><h3>Starting a skeleton</h3><p>First off, we need to learn how to make \"bones\". Your armature is made up out of a bunch of bones and we start with the \"root\" bone. The root bone is the start from which everything else branches out. When we animate or pose the model moving the root bone will move the entire armature (and the entire model).</p><p>To create a bone, move to Object Mode and hit Shift + A. Then select Armature -&gt; Single Bone. This will create a single bone wherever the cursor is. For your root bone, you'll probably want this to be centered so make sure to center your cursor (Shift + S -&gt; Cursor to Center).</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6UUtJ31.png\"></p><p><em>What the hell does \"Force Field\" even do?</em></p><p>This first bone will serve as our root. At this point it's probably a good idea to start thinking about what bones we'll even want in our end result.</p><p>Planning ahead can be as simple as a doodle over a screenshot as demonstrated below:</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/weH01S6.png\"></p><p><em>A mock-up of what the final skeleton could look like</em></p><p>Root bone in the middle and a bone for each of his arms and a bone for each of his legs. Simple as that. Maybe we'll add another bone for his \"head\".</p><p>\u00a0After creating your bone, you may notice that it's sticking straight through Kirby and you can't even see most of it.\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GIFCIOH.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Enable X-Ray in the Armature properties in the properties menu. This will allow you to see the bones through the model.\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vd8h4Mw.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IWjW8pH.png\"></p><p>Now that we can actually see the bone let's stick it in a sensible position. The root bone will not actually have any part of Kirby associated with it. It is simply a bone outside of the skeleton that you can move the entire model with, think of it like having a little action figure (it's not a doll!) with a handle on the back. The handle isn't really part of the figure.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MnimPrd.png\"></p><p>I placed it directly behind Kirby. Sometimes I place the root bone as a connected piece of the skeleton sticking out of the character's back, but Kirby is quite small and dense. When you have a character like that it's wise to get the root bone out of the way.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LadWMLc.png\"></p><p><em>An example of such a root bone</em></p><p>You'll want to name your bones appropriately for future reference. Next to the Armature properties, there are the \"Bone\" properties. Where you can name them and also set their relationship to other bones.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/I3eDqBj.png\"></p><p><em>The menu while in \"Pose Mode\"</em>. Options regarding editing are grayed out</p><h3>An armature</h3><p>Now it's time for our second bone! And the start of a bonafide skeleton!</p><p>Bones have a \"head\" and a \"tail\". You can't connect two bones by their heads or two bones by their tails. The fat end is the head and the thin end is the tail! When posing a bone the head will stay in place and the tail will move.\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HbZn8eh.png\"></p><p>While in edit mode, selecting a bone (the usual right click) and pressing E while create a new bone that is directly connected to (parented by) the selected bone. New bones will come from the tail of the selected bone.</p><p>\u00a0In most cases you'll want to create a link of bones with the new bone starting at the joint of whatever it is you're giving an armature (like an elbow).\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7Kh5Iav.png\"></p><p><em>An example layout!</em></p><p>In this case, we want the bone to be <em>disconnected</em> and not connected. The root bone, after all, is disconnected and far away from Kirby's actual body! So, untick \"Connected\" in the bone properties as shown below.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8B8hmZZ.png\"></p><p>Now you can move the bone anywhere freely with G.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oX3U7S6.png\"></p><p>I went with this bone positioning. The second bone should be parented (but not connected) to the root bone. Why? Because if the root bone moves, you want <em>EVERYTHING</em> to move, including the head. So, in that sense you want all bones in the armature to be rooted to the root bone.\u00a0</p><p>Does that mean the root bone will be the parent of every single bone? Fortunately, this is not the case! For example, if we connect our arm bones to our \"head\" bone (bone 2) because we want the arms to move when the head does, the arms will ALSO move when the head moves because the root moved.</p><p>Basically, all children of a bone will move in conjunction with the parents and grandparents and so on!</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Gf7lvw7.png\"></p><p><em>The right half of the skeleton finished</em></p><p>As with the model itself, it's not necessary to create more than one half of the bones (if the armature is symmetrical). So, this is the right half that we're aiming for.\u00a0</p><p>The fat end is what the bone will rotate around, so make sure that the fat end is in a position where it makes sense for the bone to rotate around. Why did I stick Kirby's arm bone so far inward? Well...</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nuPIqni.png\"></p><p>This wouldn't be possible otherwise!</p><p>Use the above images as reference and try to add the arm and feet bone. The arm bone should be parented to the head bone (but not connected)! And the feet bone should be parented to the root.\u00a0</p><p>Make sure to name them appropriately! I tend to name them things like hand.l (\"l\" for left) and foot.r (\"r\" for... you get it).</p><h3>Symmetry</h3><p>Now that we've finished the half of the skeleton, we'll have to duplicate that half, mirror it and rename it. Sounds like a lot of work.</p><p>Luckily, there's a tool for that \u2122 ! It's called \"Symmetrize\". It duplicates, mirrors AND renames the bones. All in one action.</p><p>You can find it at the bottom bar in Edit Mode. Select the bones you want to symmetrize (in our case, the hand and the foot). And then click Armature -&gt; Symmetrize!\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DG3ektk.png\"></p><p>Bang. Suddenly, we have a completed skeleton! The names should also be correct.</p><h3>Weights</h3><p>Now we come to the last and most time-consuming part of rigging (as we call giving a model a skeleton), weighting! Also known as \"weight painting\".\u00a0</p><p>First, we must parent our model to the armature! In Object Mode, select your model and then Shift + select (Shift is for selecting multiple things, as you know) your armature. Then press Ctrl + P. It'll pop up a parenting menu, select \"With Automatic Weights\".</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5A7LIlH.png\"></p><p>Automatic weights will try to automatically assign sensible \"weights\" to each bone, this almost never works out but it gives you a good base to work with.</p><p>The mesh of you model can be \"linked\" to a part of your skeleton or multiple bones of your skeleton. The \"weight\" determines how strongly it will react to movement of that bone.\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pUXoyI4.png\"></p><p><em>A WIP weight painted Kirby</em></p><p>Red is high weight, blue is no weight. You want stuff you DON'T want to move with that bone to be blue and you want stuff that you do want to move to be red. Stuff that you want to move with multiple bones (like around the elbow for an arm) to be half-way weighted for both bones.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GzTVgzt.png\"></p><p><em>An example of weighting the two bones of an elbow joint</em></p><p>In our case, though, we can just settle for weighting each bone to its relevant part and leave it at that.</p><p>Now, how do we actually enter this \"Weight painting mode\"? First, select the bone you want to weight paint for, then select your mesh (right click on the model itself) and press Ctrl + Tab. This will enter Weight Paint mode with that bone as the selected bone. Ctrl + right click on another bone will move to that bone, a regular right click won't do.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mFtOnSz.gif\"></p><p><em>Switching modes and a display of my weights</em></p><p>You'll note that there probably is some weight set to the bone. Try moving the bone around, <em>something</em> will move. And it'll probably look awful. Left clicking will paint over the current weights with your current brush.</p><p>Editing your brush is possible in the top left. \"Weight\" corresponds with the weight you're applying when you paint, set it to something low for more control. The brush will not paint \"through\" objects.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yfwrCOn.png\"></p><p>\"Blend\" determines the blend mode of your brush. You'll find this to be similar to what you might get in Paint Tool SAI. \"Auto Normalize\" will make it so that the combined weight on a certain part of the model can never exceed \"1\". Weight ranges from 0 (blue) to 1 (red). If you have two models applying force on one part of the model, ideally they'd both be at 0.5 each (or some ratio that adds up to 1.0).</p><p>To fix that we have to make the weighting be exactly what we want, not just approximately. Like I said before, we'll want the arm bone to correspond only with the arm and so on.</p><p>To achieve our goal we'll use a handy feature called \"face masking\". Face masking makes it so that only the faces you select will be painted. And another feature called \"Set Weight\". This will set the weight of whatever it is you've selected to EXACTLY the weight chosen in your brush.</p><p>So, first off, set the weight to 0 and make sure the root bone doesn't have any weight on any part of the model (Press A to select all -&gt; Shift + K). The entire model should now be blue when you select the root bone.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jLETDxv.png\"></p><p>Now, let's paint the hand. Since the model has two layers, you should make sure that both layers are selected when apply the weight.\u00a0</p><p>Make sure to hide the parts of the model you don't need to make things easier on you (select something and then press the 'H' key). Another tip is that selection in Edit Mode carries over to Weight Paint mode (same with hiding).\u00a0</p><p>So, hide everything but the arm in Edit Mode. Then switch back to Weight Paint mode. Now, select the arm nub, make sure the correct bone is selected and then press Shift + K to apply the 1.0 weight to the hand! It should end up looking like this:</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9HoT8AQ.png\"></p><p>Make sure that the arm is the only part of the model that has any weight for that specific bone. Now, repeat the process for each of the bones (you can refer back to the gif above to see what needs to be painted for which bone).</p><p>After painting both arms, both legs and the head (orb... body thing) you should always test out the bones before moving on! Try to break your rig as best as you can! It's better to find the flaws early on.</p><p>For an easier time posing, you can change the display mode for the bones to \"Stick\".</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VvTdE9e.png\"></p><h3>Outro</h3><p>Sadly, no bonus this time. Or is there?\u00a0</p><p>I have one last surprise, I recorded this entire series of tutorials! So you'll be able to watch all of this unfold in real time when I get to uploading these video files. I'll put some music under it. They're a bit too long for me to narrate but I think they'll serve as pretty good reference material while working on your own Kirbies!</p><p>As always, don't hesitate to ask me any questions you might have ask either here or on discord or anywhere else!
